# Notes

- why is it possible to formulate the problem as continuous problem without discrete components?
- which abstract properties do the transactions have to satisfy? which 'attacks' have to be mitigated?

todo
- reproduce simple implementation in julia JuMP

- test change of liquidity in model problem with 3 tokens
  - what is a good measure of liquidity?
    - number of fullfilled orders?
    - trading volume?
- test models with a different solver also to understand run times better
  - results: SCIP solver installed via installer takes forever on the large problem
- compare runtimes with the MIL approach

- why can the fractional crealing property not be satisfied by some postprocessing after the NL approach?

- the first formulation might be linear!!?? at least that is how it seems after applying the same tricks as done for the MIP formulations
  - NO! as it turns out, the nonlinearity might be necessary after all. limit prices should only be enforced for some of the orders!
  - BUT: by multiplying the incerrect contraint by v one recovers a wellposed problem with severely reduced dimensionality

- read some stuff in the direction of parametrized linear problems
  - after fixing prices, the problem is fully linear
  - prices enter only in the form of linear coefficients
  - is there something to be gained here in terms of efficiency?
- looks like multiparametric linear programming does not really help here
- standard approach is to reformulate the bilinear constraints using integer variables to a MIP, as done in the paper. see [https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1361014/bilinear-constraint]()
- solution of the nonlinear problem depends strongly on the initial solution
  - bug?
  - should the solution of the linear solve be postprocessed in some way?

- I should keep in mind, that my timing are on a weaker machine (i5-4200U CPU @ 1.60GHz (2 cores) vs i7-8550U CPU @ 1.80GHz (4 cores))
  - not sure how much faster their laptop actually is
  - is this approach scalable? will it help to be on a better machine? what are realistic numbers of tokens and orders?
- i could try postprocessing in each step after the linear solve, this might make the problem better behaved
  - but the nonlinear formulation seems to be rather strangely behaved. the switching of some of the conditions seems to be close to discrete. the nonlinear formulation might not be wellposed, or at the least might not satisfy constraint qualifications
- testing the nonlinear solutions agains solutions of MIP should be instructive
  - in preliminary test the mip leads to better solutions but takes a lot longer
    - for n = 10, N = 100 it takes 90s, compared to the reported 0.32s in the manuscript. so Gurobi is a lot faster or i missed some code optimizations or the realistic workload produces simpler problems
- there must be some way to exploit that the problem only contains few *difficult* variables (p) and for fixed p becomes a linear problem!
  - iterative approach seems to get stuck. maybe the mip formulation is as effecient as it gets? (up to monotonie in z etc.)

- searching for stuff like "linear programming conditional constraints" turned up an interesting reference, [](https://optimization.mccormick.northwestern.edu/index.php/Disjunctive_inequalities)
  - i should check whether the two different approaches conincide in this problem. otherwise trying the other one out might be interesting
  - problems seem to be different, so i should try it out.
  - consistent with the linked explanations, the big-M method is a lot slower than the convex hull method (n = 10, N = 200: 240s vs 1400s)
  - it lookes like the conxev hull method is essentially equivalent to the approach in the manuscript, but there are some unnecessary inequalities (which might not impect performance anyways, but lets see what happens if they are left out)
    - ok, the additional inequalities seem to imporve performanceâ€½ so it turns out that the original formulations is already quite performant
  - one thing that remains is to check ehere the equivalence z_i = 0, trade not possible is usefull. why not allow z_i = 0 for posiible trades which are however not executed?
- i should really try out some commercial solvers (e.g. gurobi) to see if my code is bad or if my solvers are slow. losing a factor of 100 in time to tolution is not really acceptable!
  - ok, gurobi seems to perform way better than the other solvers I tried (Cbc, SCIP)
- next step would be to work with more realistic data. but i do not have it... lets see.
